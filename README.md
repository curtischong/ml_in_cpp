# ml_in_cpp

I love Python but nothing beats c++. Nothing.

So I'm going to write ml algorithms by hand in CPP to:

a) understand certain algorithms in depth

b) practice c++

c) invent my own ml algorithms! (capsule ensembles seem sooooo cool)

The lineup:
1) random forest (classifier)
2) SVM
3) logistic regression
4) ARIMA (by the end of June 26 2018)

putting this here so I don't lose it:
`g++ -std=gnu++14 random_forest_classifier.cpp; ./a.out`

I just switched to a mac so here is the updated command:
`gcc -std=c++14 a.cpp -o a.out -lstdc++; ./a.out`
