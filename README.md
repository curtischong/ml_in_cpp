# ml_in_cpp

I love Python but nothing beats c++. Nothing.

So I'm going to write ml algorithms by hand in CPP to:

a) understand certain algorithms in depth

b) practice c++

c) invent my own ml algorithms! (capsule ensembles seem sooooo cool)

The lineup:
1) random forest (classifier)
2) SVM
3) logistic regression


putting this here so I don't lose it:
```g++ -std=gnu++14 random_forest_classifier.cpp; ./a.out```
